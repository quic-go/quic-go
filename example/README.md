# Example to build server and client with http3
This section will show two examples of how to use the quic library, the first is an echo example
written in the same executable, and the second is a separate client and server instance.
## Echo
Run `go run echo.go` under the [echo demo](./echo/echo.go) path.  
You are successful to run the echo demo when you see the logs.
```
Client: Sending 'foobar'
Server: Got 'foobar'
Client: Got 'foobar'
```
The TLS certificated files used by echo is automatically generated by echo.

## Server-and-client
The second case here provides separate client and server instances.
Running this example requires starting the server and client separately.
- start server  
  The server provides some flags for you.
  If you run it without flags, it serves on `https://localhost:6121/` and uses certificated files under `testdata`.

- start client  
  Use args to specify the destination. If no args, the client make a request to `https://localhost:6121/` by default.
```shell
  # under server-and-client/server
  go run main.go https://localhost:8080
```
The client ca file is stored under [client/testdata](server-and-client/client/testdata).
